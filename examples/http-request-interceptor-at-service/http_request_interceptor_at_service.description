// When we want to engage a `RequestInterceptor` for a specific service path, we can engage interceptors at
// service level through `ServiceConfig` annotation. The interceptors engaged at service level will have the 
// base path same as the target service.
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
